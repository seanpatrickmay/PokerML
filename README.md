# PokerML

This repository will be a compilation of my efforts to apply ML/AI to Poker.
The format of Poker focused on in this repo is Heads-Up No-Limit Hold-em, or HU NLHE.
There will likely be multiple attempts at strategies, with many iterations.
I am first focusing on a strategy that uses heavy abstraction, as well as monte-carlo simulation.
After this is complete, I am planning on implementing counterfactual regret.
