# PokerML

In this project, I am currently trying to implement a computer poker strategy.
Specifically, this strategy will be for Heads-Up NLHE.

TODO:
Implement preflop ranges using Monte-Carlo sim to try to find equity. (Will redo this later for greater accuracy)

Implement range equity vs hand on flop
